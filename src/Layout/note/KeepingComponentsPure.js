      Purity: Components as formulas In computer science (and especially the
      world of functional programming), a pure function is a function with the
      following characteristics:{" "}
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>It minds its own business</b>. It does not change any objects or
          variables that existed before it was called.
        </li>{" "}
        <li>
          <b>Same inputs,same output</b>. Given the same inputs, a pure function
          should always return the same result.
        </li>
      </ul>
      You might already be familiar with one example of pure functions: formulas
      in math.
